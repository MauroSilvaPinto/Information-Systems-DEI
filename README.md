# Informatic-Systems-DEI
Some old projects made for Informatics Systems Course, using JAVA

This folder contains two games: Hanoi Tower and Domino Game. 
These are both played against the computer.

Hanoi Tower was developed using very simple code as this project concerned only the first steps on programming.
The Domino Game was developed using Object Oriented Programming, where the user played against bots. These bots played, by default, their highest piece.
